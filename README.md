## Implementation:
PreLoadMe is jQuery driven. You will need to implement an up to date jQuery version and the corresponding JavaScript for executing the preloader. Add the following code right before the `</body>` tag.

    <!-- jQuery Plugin -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.3.min.js"></script>

    <!-- Preloader -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        //<![CDATA[
            $(window).on('load', function() { // makes sure the whole site is loaded 
                $('#status').fadeOut(); // will first fade out the loading animation 
                $('#preloader').delay(350).fadeOut('slow'); // will fade out the white DIV that covers the website. 
                $('body').delay(350).css({'overflow':'visible'});
              })
        //]]>
    </script>

The CSS-Markup will help you style the preloader. Make sure to include it on your website.

	body {
		overflow: hidden;
	}

	/* Preloader */
	#preloader {
		position: fixed;
		top:0;
		left:0;
		right:0;
		bottom:0;
		background-color:#fff; /* change if the mask should have another color then white */
		z-index:99; /* makes sure it stays on top */
	}

	#status {
		width:200px;
		height:200px;
		position:absolute;
		left:50%; /* centers the loading animation horizontally one the screen */
		top:50%; /* centers the loading animation vertically one the screen */
		background-image:url(../img/status.gif); /* path to your loading animation */
		background-repeat:no-repeat;
		background-position:center;
		margin:-100px 0 0 -100px; /* is width and height divided by two */
	}

Finally place the following HTML Code directly after the `<body>` tag.

	<!-- Preloader -->
	<div id="preloader">
		<div id="status">&nbsp;</div>
	</div>

The outer DIV `preloader` will be called from the CSS file and will cover the entire website with a white DIV. The inner DIV `status` will show the loading animation. Also you should not forget to give your document a proper doctype. Otherwise the preloader might not work.

### Using with AJAX requests
If you want to show preloader during AJAX request you can use the following CSS code.

	#preloader {
		position:fixed;
		left: 0px;
		top: 0px;
		width: 100%;
		height: 100%;		
		background-color:#fff; /* change if the mask should have another color then white */
		z-index:99; /* makes sure it stays on top */
	}		

	#status {
		width:200px;
		height:200px;
		position:absolute;
		left:50%; /* centers the loading animation horizontally one the screen */
		top:50%; /* centers the loading animation vertically one the screen */
		background-image:url(../img/status.gif); /* path to your loading animation */
		background-repeat:no-repeat;
		background-position:center;
		margin:-100px 0 0 -100px; /* is width and height divided by two */
	}			

Your Javascript code will look like:

	$("#status").fadeIn();
	$("#preloader").fadeIn();
	$.get(url, data, function(){
		$("#status").fadeOut();
		$("#preloader").fadeOut();
	});
